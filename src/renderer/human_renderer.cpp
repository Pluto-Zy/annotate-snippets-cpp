    ///
    /// Implementation
    /// ==============
    ///
    /// To make it easier to describe, we decompose the modified source code into lines [l0, l1,
    /// ..., ln], where l0 is the line `patch.location_begin().line()` and ln is the line
    /// `patch.location_end().line()`. For the example above, we have [l0 = 0, l1 = 1]. Similarly,
    /// we decompose `patch.replacement()` into lines [r0, r1, ..., rm]. For the example above, we
    /// have [r0 = 0, r1 = 1, r2 = 2].
    ///
    /// To determine which lines will be modified, we consider the result after applying the patch.
    /// After applying the patch, we get these lines [a0, r1, r2, ..., am], where a0 is composed of
    /// a part of l0 and r0, and am is composed of rm and a part of ln. Specifically, if m is 0, the
    /// generated result is [a0], which is composed of a part of l0, r0, and a part of ln.
    ///
    /// If a0 is the same as l0, it should not appear in the generated result because it has not
    /// been modified. Similarly, if am is the same as ln, it should not appear in the result
    /// either. We do not consider the case where there are equal strings in r1 ~ r{m-1} and l1 ~
    /// l{n-1}.
    ///
    /// Further refining the rules. If m is not 0, then a0 and l0 are the same if one of the
    /// following two conditions holds:
    /// - a0 is composed of the complete content of l0 and an empty r0;
    /// - a0 is composed of a part of l0 and r0, and the concatenated a0 is the same as l0.
    ///
    /// We only check the first condition, which means we consider a0 and l0 to be the same iff l0
    /// participates completely and r0 is empty. In this case, l0 should not be consumed, and a0
    /// should not be generated. Similarly, am and ln are the same iff ln participates completely
    /// and rm is empty. In this case, ln should not be consumed, and am should not be generated.
    ///
    /// On the other hand, if m is 0, then a0 and l0 are the same iff r0 is empty, and either:
    /// - l0 participates completely, and ln does not participate at all; or
    /// - l0 does not participate at all, and ln participates completely.
    ///
    /// If the first condition holds, then l0 should not be consumed, and a0 should not be
    /// generated. However, ln needs to be consumed (it will be marked as deleted). Similarly, if
    /// the second condition holds, then ln should not be consumed, and a0 should not be generated,
    /// but l0 needs to be consumed (it will be marked as deleted).
    ///
    /// For the example above, l0 = "int a = 1;", ln = "int b = 2;" (where n = 1), r0 = "int x =
    /// 3;", and rm = "" (where m = 2). Since r0 is not empty, a0 and l0 are not the same, so l0
    /// should be consumed, and a0 should be generated. Since rm is empty, and ln participates
    /// completely (as `patch.location_end()` points to the start of ln), am and ln are the same, so
    /// ln should not be consumed, and am should not be generated.
    ///
    /// Finally, we produce the following output:
    ///
    ///     0 - int a = 1;   <-- l0 is consumed
    ///     0 + int x = 3;   <-- a0 is generated
    ///     1 + int y = 4;   <-- a1 is generated
    ///
    /// Since l1 is not consumed and a2 is not generated, they will not be rendered.
    ///
    /// Rationale
    /// =========
    ///
    /// We introduce such rules to handle the following case (when `replacement` is empty):
    ///
    ///     0 | a b c d e \n
    ///       |           ^ patch.location_begin()
    ///     1 | f g h i j \n
    ///       |           ^ patch.location_end()
    ///
    /// If we did not have such rules, we might produce the following output:
    ///
    ///     0 - a b c d e \n
    ///     1 - f g h i j \n
    ///     0 + a b c d e \n
    ///
    /// This looks quite strange. Therefore, we introduce such rules to specifically handle the case
    /// where the patch points to the start and end of a line. This is also why we only consider the
    /// cases where r0 and rm are empty, ignoring the cases where there are equal strings in r1 ~
    /// r{m-1} and l1 ~ l{n-1}. The latter usually occurs when the user requests to delete a string
    /// and then insert an identical string. This case should be avoided by the user, so we do not
    /// handle it here.

        // intersections are inevitable regardless of their depths.
        //
        // 2. If two multi-line annotations start on the same line, the one with the greater ending
        // line should have a smaller depth, for example:

        //       | |_______^       <-- End of multi-line annotation A
        //
        // 3. If two multi-line annotations share the same starting and ending line numbers, the one
        // with the smaller starting column number should have a smaller depth, for example:
        //
        //     x |    foo(x1,

        //     x | | |    x4)
        //       | | |____^ ^
        //       | |________|      <-- End of multi-line annotations A and B
        // Note that the rendering order of the ending lines depends on the column number of the
        // ending positions rather than the depth, so if both annotations have labels, intersections
        // at the ending lines are independent of their depths.
        //
        // *Note:* The scenarios described are our desired results, but we cannot guarantee that the
        // greedy algorithm produces these exact outcomes, as it also attempts to minimize the
        // number of depths. By controlling the order of annotations in `multiline_annotations`, we

        // Here, "label1" does not overlap with any underlines but overlaps with "long label2". This
        // overlap doesn't prevent "label1" from being rendered inline.
        //
        // 2. The boundaries of the annotation's underline must be clear, meaning no other
        // annotation's underline should blend into the boundaries of this underline, for example:
        //
        //     func(arg)

        // its underline, it cannot be rendered inline, for example:

        // uniform order to all single-line annotations. Note that if A and B are both single-line
        // annotations, their underline lengths will not be the same, as annotations with the same
        // range would have already been merged.

        // Note that in some cases we encounter cyclic dependencies, where a cycle appears in the
        // directed graph we construct. For example:
        //
        // 3 | ||||     std::cout << "World";
        //   | ||||     -  ^  -  ^

        //   |    |_____|  label5
        //   |          label6
        //
        // According to Rule 1, labels from `label3` to `label6` should be arranged in the order
        // provided above. However, Rule 3 requires that `label3` should be positioned below
        // `label6`, creating a contradiction with Rule 1. This contradiction results in a cycle in
        // the directed graph we constructed, making topological sorting infeasible.
        //
        // To address this, we maintain a Disjoint Set Union while constructing the directed graph
        // and add all overlapping annotations to the same set. When applying Rule 3, we not only

    ///   `lines_after_patch_` array.

    ///   lines. If the number of lines consumed and generated by a patch is not the same, the value
    ///   of `line_offset` will be changed. When we calculate the line number of the modified line
